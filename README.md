# ZenPWX

This is the most horrendous random password creation tool ever wrote.

For the end-user, it doesn't work so bad, because basically it does its job.
It's the code that is awful and violates every rule for a good programmed code: for every case that the user can choose, there is a different function.

Just for lulz <3

```
$ ./zenpwx.sh
                                         _
                                        | |
 _______ _ __  _ ____      ____  __  ___| |__
|_  / _ \ '_ \| '_ \ \ /\ / /\ \/ / / __| '_ \
 / /  __/ | | | |_) \ V  V /  >  < _\__ \ | | |
/___\___|_| |_| .__/ \_/\_/  /_/\_(_)___/_| |_|
              | |
              |_|

Just the stupidest password creation tool
